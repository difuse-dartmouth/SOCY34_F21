This repository contains all the components of the data science module for Dartmouth College's ABCD 00: A course you'd like to take.  Click the icon next to the course name above to download the entire module.

## Primary Objective

Give students exposure to data science to help them to better understand the course material. Weekly data visualization assignments relate to each other and encourage students to think about health disparities across the many health factors they learn about in class.

From the introduction to the modules:
> Throughout the course you will complete four modules that each analyze how different factors might affect health outcomes. We focus on the state of Texas as a case study that will help us come to broader conclusions about the geography of health disparities in the United States. Following our course plan, the first module will focus on social and economic factors, the second on health behaviors, the third on physical environment, and the fourth on access to health care. We will visualize how each of these factors relates to self-rated health, through an analysis of an interactive map that overlays these data. We will consider these health outcomes in an "ideal" scenario, where we will not include demographic factors in our analysis. The conceptual map below demonstrates the relationship of each module relates to overall health.

## Student Expectations

Sociology 34, Health Disparities, is a lower major level course in the Sociology Department. While there are no prerequisites, most students have completed one or more introductory sociology courses.

## Learning Objectives
1.	Understand how to use data visualization methods.
2.	Generate and test hypotheses about relationships between different variables and health outcomes.
3.	Build and use models to predict outcomes.
